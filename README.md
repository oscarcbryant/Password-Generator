# Password-Generator

This week, we explored the creation of a random password generator. 

The passwords generated needed to contain upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters. 

We needed to deploy javascript tips and techniques learnt in class to help us form the password generation. 

Our core objective in completing this task was to learn some valuable javascript methods whilst creating the password generator which met the parameters of the criteria we set. 

We were able to determine the relationship between global variables and the broader code. 

## Key Takeaways

We practiced syntax, overcoming obstacles with positioning of braces and brackets to correct our code. 

We learnt and practiced fundamental javascript operations such as for loops, random assignment, conditional statements and commands (ie, prompt and confirm). 

We can improve on this effort in future assignments by directly linking variables within functions to achieve out outcomes. 

We were not able to deploy min / max character length on the password creation (ie, assignment read me requested min char = 8; max char = 120).

Other challenges faced were around the deployment of the random function, general syntax and best practices in running for loops. 

However, these challenges were beneficial in terms of our takeaways from the homework, as we now are better placed to deploy these more effectively.
